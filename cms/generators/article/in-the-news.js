			summary: 'Stephen Foley is looking to get his hands on some gold… the problem is that it takes too much time, costs too much money and harms the environment.\n\nThe work of his research team—made up of Loghman Moradi, research associate, and Hiwa Salimi, PhD student— changes all of that.\n"We\'ve found a simple, cheap and environmentally benign solution that extracts gold in seconds, and can be recycled and reused," said Foley, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry. "This could change the gold industry."',

			summary: 'Stephen Foley, a professor with a PhD in organic chemistry at the University of Saskatchewan, and his team, Hiwa Salimi and Loghman Moradi, first took a look at how the mining industry extracts gold three years ago. Their findings were surprising: “We looked at precious metals and gold in particular and were surprised to see that the core process in the mining industry—where they use cyanide to extract gold—hadn’t changed in 125 years,” Foley said. “Being from the University of Saskatchewan, and the province heavily involved in mining, we started to look at where we could make a contribution.”',
