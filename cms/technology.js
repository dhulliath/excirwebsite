			text: 'Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest growing waste stream on the planet which contains valuable metals, such as gold, palladium, silver and copper. Annually 50 million tones of e-waste are produced worldwide and around 300 metric tonnes of gold can potentially be recycled from this valuable source. However, less then 30% is recycled due to the lack of suitable recycling methods. \n\nThe efficiency of Excir’s new extraction method has been tested on different types of electronics scraps and in both laboratory and industrial scales. The results were more than 99.99% gold recovery. \n\nThe process shows an unpresented efficiency in the case of gold recovery from E-waste. In the case of circuit boards for example, the Excir leaching solution dissolves all surface gold in less than 20 seconds while leaving all the others metals intact. Due to its high selectivity and extremely fast kinetics, large amount of e-scraps can be treated by comparatively very small amount of our solution, this makes Excir method inexpensive, portable and easily scalable to nearly any required capacity. \n\nThe Excir process not only enables the overall gold extraction to be more environmentally friendly, by generating at least 50 times less waste and applying much milder conditions, it also enables a myriad of improvements and added efficiencies to be realized. \n\n* Greatly reduced operational cost of gold recovery          \n* Higher Gold recovery (.99.99%)                                                                \n* Extremely fast Kinetics\n* Greatly increased metals selectivity\n* Purified gold production (without added processing)\n\nThe technology is selective and non-destructive to other metals, the remaining solid waste stream’s values can be extracted as well. Copper, silver, nickel, tantalum and aluminum can all be collected for their respective values while the remaining solid waste can be repurposed into valuable products and raw materials to be sold and reused. \n\nFinally, the recycling process developed by Excir scientists is a significant advancement over the chemicals and processes currently employed (both pyro metallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods). This is much more advanced than other recent processes that have been introduced by other companies such as eVOLV ™, process developed by ATMI Inc, EnviroLeach process, UW700 and UW860 by UWin Nanotech Co.LTD.'
